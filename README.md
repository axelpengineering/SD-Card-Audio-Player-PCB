# ⚡ SD Card Audio Player PCB

Custom-designed ESP32-based audio playback system capable of playing audio tracks stored on an SD card through physical user button inputs.

---

## 📐 Overview

This project involved the complete development of an embedded audio playback system, progressing from breadboard prototyping to a custom-designed and physically assembled PCB.

An ESP32 was programmed in C++ using the Arduino IDE to process physical button inputs and control SD-card-based audio playback. The electrical circuit was first designed and tested on a breadboard before being transferred into a custom PCB using KiCad.

The final PCB was manufactured, manually soldered, assembled, and tested as a complete embedded system.

### Key Objectives

- Design a functional SD-card-based audio playback circuit
- Breadboard prototype and validate the circuit
- Program an ESP32 to control system behaviour
- Process user inputs through physical push buttons
- Implement audio playback using C++ and the Arduino IDE
- Develop a complete electrical schematic in KiCad
- Design and route a custom PCB
- Assemble and solder the manufactured PCB
- Test and debug the completed hardware and software

## 🔌 Breadboard Prototyping

The circuit was initially assembled and tested on a breadboard before committing the design to a PCB.

This allowed the electrical connections, button inputs, ESP32 firmware, and audio playback functionality to be tested and debugged early in the development process.

## 💻 ESP32 Programming

The ESP32 served as the primary controller for the system.

Custom firmware was written in C++ using the Arduino IDE to:

- Read physical push-button inputs
- Process user commands
- Control audio playback
- Select audio tracks stored on the SD card
- Interface with the playback hardware
- Coordinate overall system behaviour
- Support hardware testing and debugging

## 🧾 PCB Schematic

Once the breadboard prototype was validated, the circuit was recreated as an electrical schematic in KiCad.

The schematic defined the electrical connections between the ESP32, audio playback components, user inputs, power connections, and supporting circuitry.

## 🖥️ PCB Design

The completed schematic was converted into a custom PCB layout in KiCad.

The PCB design process included:

- Assigning component footprints
- Component placement
- Routing signal traces
- Routing power connections
- Organizing board geometry
- Checking electrical connectivity
- Performing design-rule checks
- Preparing the board for manufacturing

## 🔧 PCB Assembly & Soldering

After the PCB was manufactured, the electrical components were manually installed and soldered onto the board.

The assembled board was then inspected, tested for electrical continuity, and connected to the ESP32 and other system components.
